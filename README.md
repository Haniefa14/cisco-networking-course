Cisco Networking Devices and Initial Configuration

About This Repository

This repository contains my notes, configurations, and lab exercises from the Cisco Networking Devices and Initial Configuration course. The course provides an intermediate understanding of network design, structure, and operations, covering:
	•	🌐 Hierarchical network design principles
	•	☁️ Virtualization and cloud services
	•	🔢 Decimal, binary, and hexadecimal conversions
	•	🔗 Ethernet switching and IP addressing
	•	📡 Routing protocols and end-to-end connectivity
	•	📌 Subnetting and network segmentation
	•	🖥 Cisco IOS configuration and troubleshooting
	•	⚙️ DNS, DHCP, and ARP operations
	•	🔄 Transport layer protocols

This repository serves as a reference for building and configuring small Cisco networks and is a foundation for Cybersecurity and DevNet specializations.
